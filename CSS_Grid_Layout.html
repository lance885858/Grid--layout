        <h2>The Amazing Tweede Tol Campsite</h2>

        <img src="images\Campsite.jpg" alt="" width="1000px" height="400px">
        <p>There are 20 standard campsites, each with its own braai area. Hot and cold water ablutions are available as well as a jungle gym for children. There are also six fenced off private campsites, each with its own kitchenette, shower and toilet, for those who value their privacy. Firewood is available for sale. A maximum of six people and two cars are allowed per campsite. Extra parking is available at the picnic parking area.</p>
        <p> Campsite arrival time is between 2pm and 6pm (8pm on Fridays) and departure time is 10am. Late arrivals will need to notify the manager on 082 494 9707. Bathroom lights stay on until 10pm. Overnight camping rates exclude conservation fees and campers have exclusive use of the Wolwekloof River swimming holes. On departure at 10am, campers may pay the conservation day fee and move to the picnic area.</p>
        <p>Limietberg is a pristine nature reserve tucked away in the Du Toitskloof Mountains, near Paarl. The reserve stretches from Franschhoek in the south, eastwards towards Groot Drakenstein, and northwards as far as VoÃ«lvlei Dam and is a World Heritage Site.</p>
        <p>Limietberg offers a number of beautiful hikes through steep kloofs and deep valleys. Du Toits Peak, at 1 996m, is the highest point within the reserve. Visitors can also visit the many historical sites along the trails, including ancient rock art, a disused manganese mine and the graves of convicts who helped build the Bainskloof Pass.</p>
        <p>The reserve gets extremely hot and dry in summer, but in winter the high mountain peaks are capped with snow. When visiting Limietberg, please check the weather forecast, as hikers can get caught in unpredictable conditions and the mountainous terrain makes rescue operations difficult.
        <p>Tweede Tol is a perfect spot for picnicking, but to avoid disappointment we suggest you come early, as day visitors are limited to 120 people per day.</p>

          <h3>ABOUT TWEEDE TOL - LIMIETBERG</h3>
          <p>TWEEDE TOL is part of the Limietberg Nature Reserve - a vast 102 000ha of mountains, wildlife and fynbos. The site is located at the original tollgate of the beautiful Bainskloof Pass, built in 1853.</p>

          <p>You donât have to be the worldâs best climber to enjoy scaling Montaguâs rock faces. You donât need to have climbed at all. There are as many beginner-level options as there are scarily insane ones, and there are two very experienced local climbers, Justin and Riki Lawson, who can show you the ropes.</p>

          <p>Rocklands is found in the Cederberg mountains 250km/3 hours north of Cape Town. It is a very beautiful area in a semi-desert setting, very isolated and very safe. Rocklands is undoubtedly famous for it's world class bouldering but this should not deter you from sampling the fine sport climbing. There is a large variety of quality climbing of all grades in both bouldering and sport climbing. All the sport routes are single pitch and you will have to do a small amount of walking to get to the different areas. Most of the original climbing is situated on CapeNature land and thus day or week permits must be obtained. Permits for bouldering are not covered by Wild Cards. Many of the newer areas being developed are on private farms some which have small (30-40 rand) day fees. The rock is a fine grain sandstone of medium hardness, excellent for climbing on due to its varied features. It is quite rough so you will surely need to plan rest days to re-grow some skin.</p>

        <p>Many fishermenâs journeys are more than likely to end up in Cape Town.  There are excellent fishing spots in a number of places depending on whether you are looking for Big Game Fishing or something more along the lines of a quiet fly-fishing trip. Cape Town also offers both saltwater and freshwater fishing options, raging sea fishing or quiet rivers, streams and trout fishing in dams.</p>

        <p>This route goes up the fabulous IndiaâVenster Route, follows a spectacular traverse on the face of Table Mountain, and then descends steeply down Yellowstone Gully: not for the faint-hearted! If you were even slightly out of your comfort zone on the IndiaâVenster scrambles, donât proceed!</p>

        <p>The Alphen Trail is possibly one of the most popular of the green belt walks of the Constantia Valley. The walk can start at either end, but most people park their cars on the bend of Alphen Drive that leads off Constantia Main Road to the Alphen Hotel (a national monument in its own right with beautiful gardens and tea to die for, if youâre looking for somewhere to do âhigh teaâ before or after your walk). The trail winds along the Diep River to the Constantiaberg Mountain and in places allows one to walk on either side of the river, with a number of bridge crossings. Itâs a beautiful walk filled with lush grass, trees, beautiful skies and the Le Sueur Meadow on the far end of the walk towards Hohenort. People take their dogs and families on Sunday afternoon rambles here. The walk never fails to restore the soul, demanding little from one and yet giving so much in return by way of views and fresh air.</p>
